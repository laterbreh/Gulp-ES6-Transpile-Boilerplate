#Transpiling ES6 to ES5 using Gulp

Boilerplate configuration for transpiling es6 to es5 using gulp watcher and babel. 

**To use:**
`npm install`
`gulp`

Everytime you save inside the src folder, gulp will transpile your code and place it in the dist folder. 

For more complex projects, you will need to edit the gulpfile.js file to suit your needs. 

Happy Hacking!
